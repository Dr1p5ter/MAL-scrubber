## Description

> This project is dedicated to my personal growth with MongoDB and Flask. I want to emphasize I am not finished with all the parts but I am almost finished with the application portion. Most of the heavy lifting will be done through local instances that incorperating a naive approach to cacheing. Database retrieval will be set to default midst runtime with Flask. This portion of the project has not been implemented yet.

> The subdirectory '/util' contains most if not all of the helper functions that Flask will be using on runtime. app.py will be dedicated for Flask and all other html,css,js files will have their own subdirectories in the future.

## Installation

> This project right now supports the us and deployment of scrubber.py which will be in the home directory. To get started, open up a bash terminal and run make_venv.sh to initiate an enviornment. This is not manditory but will be good practive when launching app.py in the future. Then you just need to enter the enviornment and run scrubber.py to begin populating the data subdirectories.

#### Disclaimer
> I will change this at some point consult README.md for changes.

## Testing

> Testing files will be written again at some point using pytest instead of unittest

### MongoDB

> Connecting to MongoDB should be looked at through the tutorial that MongoDB provides. I will try to make this more accessable in the future. In the meantime, please look at 'util/mongodb.py' for information on connecting your instance of this database. Upon runtime I will have archeive data to play with so running scrubber.py will not be necessary. I will do the heavy lifting.

## Current Plans For Now

> Making the testing documents with pytest will be my new priority once I finalize other bug fixes. Releases are to come.
