## things I need to do:

* fix issue with anime entries being present in multiple seasons within archive
* set up flask API to handle read/write functionality
* set up flask API for GUI implimentation
* create a look up function for anime pictures

## testing

* update testing documents using pytest instead of unittest (I think this would be better)
